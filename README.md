# The Never Ending Coding Adventure: Codehog Day

This project was built for the 2021 Retro Gaming Hackathon of Code Institute.
The purpose of the project was to build a retro-styled game based on the earliest developed computer games, as well as growing as (aspirin]g) developers by working together as a team and manage version control of the to-be developed product.

#### Typography

For this project we used the "Press Start 2P" (designed by CodeMan38) as a font.
This is a pixellated font and it brings out the retro feel of the early era of gaming.

### - [Helena Johansson](https://github.com/Odden69)
  - I am probably the person in this team with the least gaming experience. But I am the oldest, hence the most retro. Joining this hackathon has been so rewarding. I have learned so much from my fabulous fellow team mates.

### - [John Doyle](https://github.com/Aramantos)
  - Gaming has always been a passion of mine so this hackathon was a must. A retro game will make a proud addition to the portfolio and it was a great experience shaping it with the team. Hope you all enjoy it.

### - [Katherine Biggs](https://github.com/Kat632)
  - I've been gaming since I was about 8. I had an Acorn Electron. These days I'm a Simmer. The fastest thing I can type is "testingcheatsenabled true". This is a Sims joke that probably no one will understand.

### - [Patrik Österljung](https://github.com/oljung)
  - Ever since I played the NES at my uncles when I was five, gaming has been a huge part of my life. When I saw this Hackathon, I had to join even though I knew nothing about what it mean. Now that I know, that it means working with a team to make a project take form, I can safely say this will not be my last. This has been awesome! Thank you guys and please enjoy the game!

### - [Yorick van den Hurk](https://github.com/nowane)
  - I've always had a lot of fun gaming when I was a kid. Seeing this theme for a hackathon come by was the last push I needed to engage more in the Code Institute community. Luckily I landed in an awesome team of truely awesome characters, with who I've been glad to had the pleasure working with.
